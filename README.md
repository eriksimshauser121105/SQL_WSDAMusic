# SQL_WSDAMusic - Missing Money Matters

# In this SQLite project, I analyzed the various schema and tables of WSDA Music's database, containing data on sales, customers, and employees. 

# I conducted high-level analysis of the company's transaction records in the years 2011 and 2012 using complex queries, incorporating JOINs, aggregate functions, date/time functions, and nested queries to identify discrepancies in the financials.

# Identifying these discrepancies allowed conclusions to be drawn on specific employee-customer interactions that affected the company's financials between 2011 and 2012.
